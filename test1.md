# Psych 101 Test 1

## Chapter 1 - Psychology: The Science of Behaviour

**Psychology**: the study of the behaviour and the mind

**Behaviour**: actions and responses that can be **directly observed**

**Mind**: the internal processes such as thoughts/feelings (unobservable)

### Goals of Psychology

1. **Describe** how people behave
2. **Explain** the causes of these behaviours
3. **Predict** how people will behave in certain conditions
4. **Control** behaviour to enhance human life

### Perspectives on Psychology

#### Structuralism (Wundt)

+ Study the brain by breaking it into basic components (what?)

#### Functionalism

+ Focus on the functions of consciousness (why?)

#### Psychodynamic Perspective (Freud)

+ Inner workings of personality (psychoanalysis = unconsciousness)

#### Behavioural Perspective (John Locke, Pavlov, Watson, BF Skinner)

+ We start with blank slate, our nature shaped by environment
+ Watson: "give me some babies, I can make them doctors, lawyers"
+ Watson: Little Albert, taught fear of fur! By conditioning

#### Humanistic Perspective

+ Free will, personal growth, finding meaning in one's existence
+ Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

#### Cognitive Perspective

+ Humans are information processors, actions governed by thoughts
+ Gestalt = whole, brain organizes info such that whole is greater than sum of each part
+ Gestalt: Figure-ground, closure, proximity, similarity

#### Sociocultural Perspective

+ Cultural norms and people around us influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviour
+ Asch Experiment of comparing lines: we conform to those around us

#### Biological Perspective

+ Examine brain, genes, evolution
+ Behavioural Neuroscience: examine brain and physiology that underlie behaviours, sensory input, emotions, thoughts
+ H.M. hippocampus extraction => no new memories
+ Capgras syndrome: parents are imposters

## Chapter 2 - Behaviour + Scientific Method

### Attitude

**Curiosity**, **Skepticism**, **Open-mindedness**

### Correlational Research

+ Study correlation between 2 variables (scatterplot)
+ Correlation coefficient r (-1 to 1), positive/negative correlation

### Experimental Research

+ Determine **causation** by controlling every variable, testing control group and experimental group

### Case Study

+ In-depth analysis of specific event or person (HM, Capgras David, Phineas Gage)
+ Can study something rare, but bad for cause/effect analysis

### Naturalistic Observation

+ Study things without disturbing them, simply gather large data and analyse

### Surveys

+ Give surveys to people randomly, stratified sampling, etc.

## Chapter 3 - Biological Foundations of Behaviour

### Brain

+ 3 pounds, 100 billion neurons
+ Cerebral cortex: outer layer of brain (main part)
+ Frontal (motor, complex), Temporal (language, hearing), Parietal (senses), Occipital (vision), Cerebellum
+ P Gage: frontal lobe was damaged, so personality changed
+ Lateralization: function is either in left brain or right brain

### Neurons

+ Cell body (soma), dendrites (input) , axon (output)
+ Blood-brain barrier, action potential, depolarization, myelin sheath, synapse, neurotransmitters
+ Plasticity: neurons can change structure and function (affected by genetics/environment)
+ Younger people have more synapses, so can recover faster

#### Aphasia (loss of communication)

+ Broca's Area: hard to find words
+ Wernicke's Area: hard to make sense

### Motivation

+ Pleasure centre: **Nucleus accumbens** (Olds and Milner)

#### Psychopathy

+ Emotional dysfunction and antisocial behaviour
+ Severe lack of empathy
+ Could this disorder be useful? (train dilemma)

#### Prosopagnosia

+ Difficulty recognizing faces
+ Shows there is a specific area in brain for faces

#### Synesthesia

+ Confusing senses (smelling sounds, hearing colours, seeing numbers as coloured)

## Chapter 4 - Genes, Evolution, and Behaviour

Genotype: dominant/recessive (genetic makeup from birth)
Phenotype: expressed characteristic

#### Jim Twins

+ Identical twins, different lives, same life details (simply a coincidence)
