## Chapter 1 - Psychology: The Science of Behaviour

**Psychology**: the study of the behaviour and the mind

**Behaviour**: actions and responses that can be **directly observed**

**Mind**: the internal processes such as thoughts/feelings (unobservable)

### Goals of Psychology

1. **Describe** how people behave
2. **Explain** the causes of these behaviours
3. **Predict** how people will behave in certain conditions
4. **Control** behaviour to enhance human life

### Perspectives on Psychology

#### Structuralism (Wundt)

+ Study the brain by breaking it into basic components (what?)

#### Functionalism

+ Focus on the functions of consciousness (why?)

#### Psychodynamic Perspective (Freud)

+ Inner workings of personality (psychoanalysis = unconsciousness)

#### Behavioural Perspective (John Locke, Pavlov, Watson, BF Skinner)

+ We start with blank slate, our nature shaped by environment
+ Watson: "give me some babies, I can make them doctors, lawyers"
+ Watson: Little Albert, taught fear of fur! By conditioning

#### Humanistic Perspective

+ Free will, personal growth, finding meaning in one's existence
+ Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

#### Cognitive Perspective

+ Humans are information processors, actions governed by thoughts
+ Gestalt = whole, brain organizes info such that whole is greater than sum of each part

#### Sociocultural Perspective

+ Cultural norms and people around us influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviour
+ Asch Experiment of comparing lines: we conform to those around us

#### Biological Perspective

+ Examine brain processes and bodily functions
+ Behavioural Neuroscience: examine brain and physiology that underlie behaviours, sensory input, emotions, thoughts
