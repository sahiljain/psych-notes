# Psych 101 - Test 3

## Chapter 8 - Memory
+ **Memory**: processes to record and retrieve information
+ Process: Encoding, Storage, and Retrieval
	1. Encoding - translation into neural code
	2. Storage - retaining information over time
	3. Retrieval - pulling information out of storage
+ 3 levels to memory: **sensory memory**, **short-term memory**, **long-term memory**
	+ Sensory: holds sensory information just long enough to be recognized
	+ Short-term: holds information that we are conscious of, transfers from sensory mem after encoding
	+ Long-term: large library of permanently stored memories

### Sensory Memory
+ holds information from senses for 0.5 to 2 seconds
+ made of registers: iconic (visual), echoic (sound, lasts longer)

### Short-term Memory
+ holds information we are currently conscious of
+ known as **working memory**
+ contains data from sensory memory converted to memory codes
+ **Memory Codes**: representation of information as images, sound, meaning, motor movements
+ limited in duration and capacity: 20 seconds, and 7 +/- 2 items
+ combining items into larger coherent units is called **chunking**
+ **Maintenance Rehearsal**: simply repeating information
+ **Elaborative Rehearsal**: focusing on meaning, making connections to existing memories
+ **Rehearsal** increaes duration of memory in short-term, or transfers to long-term
+ **Episodic Buffer**: temporary integration of working memories and long-term memories to perform a calculation
+ Elaborative rehearsal is way better than maintenance, you have to process what you are reading

### Long-term Memory
+ our vast library of durable stored memories
+ we form long-term memories until we die
+ capacity is unlimited
+ **Serial Position Effect**: **Primacy Effect** + **Recency Effect**
+ **Primacy Effect**: superior recall of early items in a list, because we rehearse earlier words more times
+ **Recency Effect**: superior recall of recent items in a list, because they haven't been replaced by new words

#### Types of Long-term Memory
+ Declarative Memory vs Procedural Memory
+ **Declarative Memory**: facts, information, and personal life events that are verbal or visual
	+ Two types: Episodic Memory(memory of personal events, people places and experiences) vs Semantic Memory(general knowledge, facts)
+ **Procedural Memory**: skillz, habits, and classically conditioned responses
+ Explicit vs Implicit Memory
+ **Explicit Memory**: conscious or intentional memory retrieval
+ **Implicit Memory**: when memory influences our behaviour without us being aware

### Extraordinary Memory
+ Daniel Tammet: learned a language, memorized pi to 20k digits, date calculations
+ Kim Peek: 98% recall after reading, reads 2 pages in 10 seconds
+ Stephen Wiltshire: photographic memory of cities + drawing them
+ Super autobiographical memory: remember every day of your life

### Processing
+ **Effortful processing**: initiated intentionally and requires conscious attention
+ **Automatic processing**: occurs without intention and minimal attention
+ you remember things better the more deeply you process them

### Organization and Imagery
+ JC the Waiter is good at memorizing because he encodes by category, and makes acronyms
+ **Mnemonic Devices**: any type of memory aid, or strategy to help you remember (chunking, loci, acronym, acrostic)
+ **Dual coding theory**: info stored in long-term memory both verbally and non-verbally
+ **Loci**: place information in a 3D world
+ **Schema**: mental framework of something about the world already in memory (think about laundry paragraph, or reading music, or chess experts)
+ Deese Roediger McDermott effect: false memories based on closely related true ones (list with sleep related words, but not "sleep")
+ **Misinformation Effect**: Loftus Palmer, the distortion of a memory by feeding wrong information after event

### Encoding
+ prior knowledge = schemas = mental framework around idea (laundry example)
+ encoding images into words (assigning labels), alters recall of image to match word (glasses/dumbbells), (Carmichael Hogan Walters)
+ expertise (Chase Simon), better chess player = better schema = better memory of valid chess board
+ **Encoding Specificity Principle**: memory enhanced when conditions match between retrieval and encoding process
+ **Context-Dependent Memory**: same scene, environment between recall/encoding
+ **State-Dependent Memory**: same state of arousal, drugs, but not mood
+ **Mood-Congruent Recall**: recall information or events that are congruent to current mood

### Biology of Memory
+ **Engram**: physical trace of memory in brain
+ **Hippocampus**: encode, retrieve, and consolidate declarative LTMs
+ **Cerebellum**: procedural LTM formation
+ **Cerebral Cortex**: encodes info from sensory registers
+ **Prefrontal Cortex**: working memory (STM)
+ **Amygdala**: emotions of memory
+ **Thalamus**: damage results in both types of amnesia


## Chapter 9 - Language and Thinking
+ **Mental Representations**: the thing humans are awesome at, forming images and ideas in our head (the simulator)

### Language
+ Language (communication) is why humans dominate other animals
+ **Language**: Symbolic (words), Structure (grammar), Generativity (infinite sentences), Displacement (talk about non-present)
+ Surface Structure = grammer, Deep Structure = meaning
+ **Phoneme**: smallest unit of discernable sound (46 in English)
+ **Morpheme**: smallest unit of meaning (-s, -ed, pre-), 100,000 in English
+ Hierarchy: Phonemes -> Morphemes -> Words -> Phrases -> Sentences -> Discourse
+ **Pragmatics**: practical use of language for socializing
+ **Bottom-up Processing**: processing smallest elements, then building up
+ **Top-down Processing**: using prior knowledge to interpret sensory information
+ **Aphasia*: damage to speech-related areas
+ **Broca's**: speech production
+ **Wernicke's**: speech comprehension
+ Language is in left-hemisphere for males, both for females
+ **LAD**: Language Acquisition Device, innate rules of grammer of all languages
+ **Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis**: Language determines the range of our thought, and how we think

### Thinking
+ 3 types: Propositional Thought, Imaginal Thought, Motoric Thought
+ **Propositional Thought**: express a statement of facts (combination of concepts)
+ **Concept**: basic unit of semantic memory, a mental category
+ **Prototypes**: member of a category
+ **Imaginal Thought**: images in our mind
+ **Motoric Thought**: mental representations of motor movement

#### Reasoning
+ Two types: Deductive Reasoning and Inductive Reasoning
+ **Deductive Reasoning**: reason from general principles (premises) to reach conclusion
+ **Inductive Reasoning**: start with specific facts and develop general rule (bottom-up)
+ Stumbling blocks: irrelevant information (focusing on useless info), failure to deduce (not applying knowledge), Belief Bias (abandon logic, use personal beliefs), negative set (use an old approach rather than novel and better one)
+ **Anchoring**: tendency to use available estimates to influence final estimate

#### Problem Solving
+ Frame and understand problem -> generate hypotheses/possible solution -> test hypothesis/solutions by ruling out or proving -> evaluate results and repeat
+ **Framing**: mental representation of problem, better frame -> better solutions
+ **Mental Set**: tendency to stick to past solutions
+ **Problem-solving Schemas**: mental blueprints or scripts for solving a class of problems
+ **Experts**: large number of schemas to solve many classes of problems
+ **Algorithms**: formulas that automatically generate the right solution
+ **Heuristics**: general strategies to apply to classes of problems (usually works or simplifies problem)
	+ **Means-end analysis**: identify differences between current state and desired state, then reduce diff
	+ **Subgoal analysis**: formulate smaller steps to achieve solution
	+ **Representative Heuristic**: likeliness that x in A is proportional to how closely we think x fits in A
	+ **Availability Heuristic**: base judgements based on memories/stored info
+ **Confirmation Bias**: we tend to look for evidence to confirm beliefs than deny them
+ **Creative Problem Solving**: Creativity (produce something new of value), Divergent thinking (novel ideas, 9 dots), Functional Fixedness (blind to different function/interpretations, candle wall), Incubation (creative solutions pop into mind)
+ **Insight**: sudden perception of useful relationships (Kohler chimps, Rebus puzzles)
+ **Wisdom**: System of knowledge about life (facts, procedures, lifespan, values and priorities, uncertainty)
