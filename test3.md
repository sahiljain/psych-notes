# Psych 101 - Test 3

## Chapter 8 - Memory
+ **Memory**: processes to record and retrieve information
+ Process: Encoding, Storage, and Retrieval
	1. Encoding - translation into neural code
	2. Storage - retaining information over time
	3. Retrieval - pulling information out of storage
+ 3 levels to memory: **sensory memory**, **short-term memory**, **long-term memory**
	+ Sensory: holds sensory information just long enough to be recognized
	+ Short-term: holds information that we are conscious of, transfers from sensory mem after encoding
	+ Long-term: large library of permanently stored memories

### Sensory Memory
+ holds information from senses for 0.5 to 2 seconds
+ made of registers: iconic (visual), echoic (sound, lasts longer)

### Short-term Memory
+ holds information we are currently conscious of
+ known as **working memory**
+ contains data from sensory memory converted to memory codes
+ **Memory Codes**: representation of information as images, sound, meaning, motor movements
+ limited in duration and capacity: 20 seconds, and 7 +/- 2 items
+ combining items into larger coherent units is called **chunking**
+ **Maintenance Rehearsal**: simply repeating information
+ **Elaborative Rehearsal**: focusing on meaning, making connections to existing memories
+ **Rehearsal** increaes duration of memory in short-term, or transfers to long-term
+ **Episodic Buffer**: temporary integration of working memories and long-term memories to perform a calculation
+ Elaborative rehearsal is way better than maintenance, you have to process what you are reading

### Long-term Memory
+ our vast library of durable stored memories
+ we form long-term memories until we die
+ capacity is unlimited
+ **Serial Position Effect**: **Primacy Effect** + **Recency Effect**
+ **Primacy Effect**: superior recall of early items in a list, because we rehearse earlier words more times
+ **Recency Effect**: superior recall of recent items in a list, because they haven't been replaced by new words

#### Types of Long-term Memory
+ Declarative Memory vs Procedural Memory
+ **Declarative Memory**: facts, information, and personal life events that are verbal or visual
	+ Two types: Episodic Memory(memory of personal events, people places and experiences) vs Semantic Memory(general knowledge, facts)
+ **Procedural Memory**: skillz, habits, and classically conditioned responses
+ Explicit vs Implicit Memory
+ **Explicit Memory**: conscious or intentional memory retrieval
+ **Implicit Memory**: when memory influences our behaviour without us being aware

### Extraordinary Memory
+ Daniel Tammet: learned a language, memorized pi to 20k digits, date calculations
+ Kim Peek: 98% recall after reading, reads 2 pages in 10 seconds
+ Stephen Wiltshire: photographic memory of cities + drawing them
+ Super autobiographical memory: remember every day of your life

## Processing
+ **Effortful processing**: initiated intentionally and requires conscious attention
+ **Automatic processing**: occurs without intention and minimal attention
+ you remember things better the more deeply you process them

## Organization and Imagery
+ JC the Waiter is good at memorizing because he encodes by category, and makes acronyms
+ **Mnemonic Devices**: any type of memory aid, or strategy to help you remember (chunking, loci, acronym, acrostic)
+ **Dual coding theory**: info stored in long-term memory both verbally and non-verbally
+ **Loci**: place information in a 3D world
+ **Schema**: mental framework of something about the world already in memory (think about laundry paragraph, or reading music, or chess experts)
+ Deese Roediger McDermott effect: false memories based on closely related true ones (list with sleep related words, but not "sleep")
+ **Misinformation Effect**: Loftus Palmer, the distortion of a memory by misleading post-event information

## Encoding
+ prior knowledge = schemas = mental framework around idea (laundry example)
+ encoding images into words (assigning labels), alters recall of image to match word (glasses/dumbbells), (Carmichael Hogan Walters)
+ expertise (Chase Simon), better chess player = better schema = better memory of valid chess board
+ **Encoding Specificity Principle**: memory enhanced when conditions match between retrieval and encoding process
+ **Context-Dependent Memory**: same scene, environment between recall/encoding
+ **State-Dependent Memory**: same state of arousal, drugs, but not mood
+ **Mood-Congruent Recall**: recall information or events that are congruent to current mood
